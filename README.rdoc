== as your app:

- do you have the right schema and db structure?
- are your views handling more than they should?
- are you sending too many queries to db?
- are you DRY?
+
- are your controller actions doing too much?
- are your actions/methods doing unnecessary work?
- are you hitting the database (insert, update, etc.) when you don't need to?
- are you duplicating view code?
